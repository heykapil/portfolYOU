# **Privacy Policy**

<h2><a id="section1"></a>1. Who we are</h2>
<p>Using Blockchain Ltd <strong>("Using Blockchain Ltd", “Using Blockchain</strong>”, "<strong>UBC Digital</strong>", “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”) provides an UBC Digital suite of technologies to publishers for use on their websites (“<strong>UBC Digital Tools</strong>”). UBC Digital Tools provide website owners with the capability to engage users of their websites with social networks and other destinations via a browser plug-in or website plug-in. With UBC Digital Tools, publishers can (i) enable users to share, follow, view, recommend and interact with the publisher’s content, and (ii) collect information from those users as a result of their visit. The UBC Digital Tools are available for download through UBC.Digital or through selected third party sites.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the processing of personal information by Using Blockchain Ltd of:</p>
<ul class="obullets">
<li>visitors and users of the various Using Blockchain Ltd sites, including our websites on <a href="https://ubc.digital">ubc.digital</a>, <a href="https://dings.app">dings.app</a>, computer or mobile software applications and our social media pages that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as the "<strong>UBC Digital Sites</strong>");</li>
<li>attendees of Using Blockchain Ltd-sponsored events;</li>
<li>customers and prospective customers and their representatives;</li>
<li>subscribers to UBC Digital Magazine; and</li>
<li>suppliers and business partners and their representatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>When interacting with our websites, you also have the ability to link or connect with non-Using Blockchain Ltd websites, services, social networks, applications or other features. Enabling these features will lead to other parties than Using Blockchain Ltd processing information about you. Using Blockchain Ltd does not have any control over these features of other parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these parties before using these features. This UBC Digital Privacy Policy (also referred to as the “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) informs consumers about the collection, use, sharing, and selling (collectively referred to as “<strong>processing</strong>” or “<strong>process</strong>”) of your personal information in connection with Using Blockchain Ltd's provision of the UBC Digital Tools and UBC Digital Sites. It also explains the privacy rights you have in relation to these processing activities. When you interact with a website on which a publisher has installed UBC Digital Tools, your direct interactions are primarily with that publisher. In our <a href="/terms-of-service">UBC Digital Terms of Service</a> with the publisher, we require that the publisher informs you directly of how it collects and uses your personal information in this context, and gets your consent where appropriate. We may then also receive information about you via your interactions with the publisher’s UBC Digital Tools, so this Privacy Policy informs you how we process that personal information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on June 25, 2020. However, the Privacy Policy can change over time, for example to meet changing business or legal requirements. The most up-to-date version can be found on this <a href="/privacy">website</a>. In case there is an important change that we want to highlight to you, we will also inform you in another appropriate way (for example, via a pop-up notice or statement of changes on our website).</p>

<li><strong>Right to access and/or have your information provided to you</strong> You can also ask us for a copy of information about you and can ask for a copy of information about you provided in machine readable form if you reside in the EU or other jurisdiction that provides you this right as a matter of law.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can exercise these choices in accordance with applicable laws as specified on our <a href="/privacy-choices">Privacy Choices page</a>, or by filling out our <a href="http://ubc.digital/inquiry-privacy-choice">inquiry form</a>. <strong>Opt-out and object to our use of personal information.</strong> Using Blockchain Ltd offers multiple ways for you to opt out of third party sharing or selling and object to our use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UBC Digital Opt-out.</strong> If you prefer that Using Blockchain Ltd and our third party partners do not receive your personal information via Cookies and Pixels for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, you may opt out of collection at any time via the UBC Digital Cloud opt-out, available at <a href="https://ubc.digital/optout#personal-info">https://ubc.digital/optout#personal-info</a>. Upon opting out, we will place an opt-out Cookie on your device. The opt-out Cookie tells the UBC Digital Tools not to include information from that device in UBC Digital Data.</li>
<li><strong>AdTech Industry Opt-out.</strong> You may also opt out of third party sharing or selling by the UBC Digital Cloud by using the opt-out tools provided by the following industry groups:
<ul class="obullets">
<li>Digital Advertising Alliance (‘DAA’): <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a></li>
<li>Network Advertising Initiative (‘NAI’): <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org</a></li>
<li>European Interactive Digital Adverting Alliance (‘EDAA’): <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a> and <a href="http://www.edaa.eu/">http://www.edaa.eu/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Using Blockchain Ltd honors “Do Not Track” browser settings, meaning we will not track your browser for marketing purposes while you have “Do Not Track” turned on in your browser settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that if you opt out using the first two opt out tools, you may still temporarily receive marketing due to marketing campaigns already underway. However, you will be opted-out of all future marketing campaigns that use the UBC Digital Data. Also note that the first two opt out tools are currently cookie-based and prevent Using Blockchain Ltd from using, sharing, or selling your personal information for interest-based advertising on the browser on which they are installed. As a result, the opt out will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies and may not function where cookies are sometimes automatically disabled or removed (e.g., certain mobile devices and operating systems). If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt out again. Using Blockchain Ltd does not use persistent, unique identifiers to revive a previously opted-out profile or deleted cookie. <strong>Access personal information</strong> In order to exercise your right to access your online information, you can use the <a href="https://ubc.digital/registry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UBC Digital Data Registry</a> (“<strong>Registry</strong>”) to view the online segments Using Blockchain Ltd has associated with your device. By accessing this Registry, you can view the types of third-party interest segments that are shared with or sold to Using Blockchain Ltd customers. Please note that the interest segments you see within the Registry is information about you from the profile associated with the specific browser, computer or device that you are using to visit the Registry. You may see different segments when viewing the Registry from a different browser, computer or device. We therefore recommend using different browsers and devices when accessing the Registry. <strong>Delete personal information</strong> You can erase or delete the UBC Digital Data Using Blockchain Ltd is processing about your device or remove segments in the <a href="https://ubc.digital/registry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Registry</a> by opting out of Using Blockchain Ltd services using the <a href="https://ubc.digital/registry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opt-out tool</a>.</p>
