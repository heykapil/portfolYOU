# **Terms of Service**

<h2>The Gist</h2>
We (the <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/about">team at Using Blockchain Ltd</a>) are on a mission to make the web of distributed ledgers a better place. We hope you love our products and services — from website publishing tools to blockchain deployment to plugin solutions to security backup systems to management tools for global companies to the next great idea that we haven’t even thought of yet — as much as we love creating them.

These Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services. Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions.

We’ve decided to make these Terms available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license. You can grab a copy of these Terms and other legal documents on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/legalmattic">Github</a>. You’re more than welcome to copy them, adapt them, and repurpose them for your own use. Just make sure to revise the language so that your Terms reflect your actual practices.
<h2><a id="section1"></a>1. Terms of Service</h2>
These Terms govern your access to and use of Using-Blockchain.com, UBC.Digital, www.ubc.digital, tools.ubc.digital, YourDLT.com, and YourDLT.Tools, as well as all content and Using Blockchain Ltd products and services (for example, plugin services or development activities available at or through these websites (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”).

These Terms also govern visitors’ access to and use of any websites that use our Services, such as websites hosted on Using-Blockchain.com, UBC.Digital and YourDLT.com that are operated by our users.

For some of Using Blockchain Ltd's other products, services, and programs such as ChainCommerce, our Affiliate Program, and our Refer-A-Friend Program, additional Terms of Service may apply and will be posted on the respective websites.

Our Services are offered subject to your acceptance, without modification, of all of the terms and conditions contained herein and all other operating rules, policies (including, without limitation, <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/privacy/">Using Blockchain Ltd's Privacy Policy</a>), and procedures that may be published from time to time by Using Blockchain Ltd (collectively, the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”). You agree that we may automatically upgrade our Services, and the Agreement will apply to any upgrades.

Please read the Agreement carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to become bound by the Agreement. If you do not agree to all the terms of the Agreement, then you may not access or use our Services.

&nbsp;
<h2><a id="section2"></a>2. Who’s Who</h2>
Throughout these Terms, “<strong>you</strong>” applies to both individuals and entities that access or use our Services. If you are an individual using our Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to the Agreement and that by using our Service(s), you are accepting the Agreement on behalf of that entity.

We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and all countries located in the European continent. If you reside in the “Designated Countries,” your Agreement is with Using Blockchain Ltd.

We refer to Using Blockchain Ltd. as “<strong>Using Blockchain Ltd</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>” throughout these Terms.

&nbsp;
<h2><a id="section3"></a>3. Your Account</h2>
Where use of our Services requires an account, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information when you register for an account and keep the information current. This is important because sometimes we may need to send you notable updates (for example, about changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy), or we may want to let you know about and make informed choices in response to legal inquiries or complaints.

You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under your account. You are responsible for keeping your account information up-to-date and for keeping your password secure.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any Service-related website, store, or other content, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in connection with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website, or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

When you create a Using-Blockchain.com account, a UBC.Digital account or a YourDLT.com account, we consider that to be an inquiry about our products and services, which means that we may contact you to share more details about what we have to offer. Don’t worry — if you aren’t interested in learning more, you can opt out of the marketing communication, whether it’s an email, phone call, or text message.

&nbsp;
<h2><a id="section4"></a>4. Minimum Age Requirements</h2>
Our Services are not directed to children. Access to and use of our Services is only for those over the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If you are younger than this, you may not register for or use our Services.

&nbsp;
<h2><a id="section5"></a>5. Responsibility of Visitors and Users</h2>
We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the content (such as, but not limited to, text, photo, video, audio, code, computer software, items for sale, or other materials) posted to our Services by users or anyone else (“<strong>Content</strong>”) and are not responsible for any use or effects of such Content. So, for example:
<ul>
 	<li>We do not endorse any Content or represent that Content is accurate, useful, or non-harmful. Content could be offensive, indecent, or objectionable; include technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, or other errors; or violate or infringe the privacy, publicity rights, intellectual property rights (see our Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy section to submit copyright complaints), or other proprietary rights of third parties.</li>

 	<li>We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from anyone’s use, purchase, or downloading of Content.

 	<li>Please note that additional third party terms and conditions may apply to the downloading, copying, purchase, or use of Content.</li>
</ul>
We also have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and web pages that link to, or are linked from, Using-Blockchain.com, YourDLT.com or our other Services. For example:
<ul>
 	<li>We do not have any control over those websites and are not responsible for their contents or their use.</li>
 	<li>The existence of a link to or from one of our Services does not represent or imply that we endorse such website.</li>
 	<li>You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content.</li>
 	<li>We disclaim any responsibility for any harm resulting from non-Using Blockchain Ltd websites.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h2>
<h3>a. Using Blockchain Ltd and UBC Digital Magazine Fees</h3>
<strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of our Services are offered for a fee, such as UBC.Digital Tools, YourDLT Tools, YourDLT plans, Using-Blockchain.com plans, UBC.Digital plans and some Ecommerce Services (collectively, “<strong>Paid Services</strong>”). By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees (for example, <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/pricing/">Using-Blockchain.com fees</a>, and fees associated with specific features, such as <a href="https://support.using-blockchain.com/domains/domain-pricing-and-available-tlds/">domain name registration and renewal</a>). Depending on the Paid Service, there may be one-time fees, recurring fees, or revenue-based fees. For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in regular automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team. For revenue-based fees — such as <a href="https://support.using-blockchain.com/recurring-payments-button/#related-fees">fees for Recurring Payments</a> for your website’s subscriptions — you pay us a percentage of the revenue your website generates. Revenue-based fees are ongoing.

<strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are exclusive of applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges now in force or enacted in the future (“<strong>Taxes</strong>”). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Fees you’ve paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes.

<strong>Payment.</strong> If your payment fails or if Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general.

<strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable subscription fee (as well as any Taxes). By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, if you purchase a Using-Blockchain.com annual plan, you will be charged each year for the following 12-month period. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you are checking your email (including any spam or other filters) in order to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of renewal. The date for the automatic renewal is determined automatically based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. You can view your renewal date for Using-Blockchain.com Paid Services by visiting your <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/me/purchases">Manage Purchases page</a>. For more information about how Using-Blockchain.com subscriptions work, please see our <a href="https://support.using-blockchain.com/manage-purchases/">Manage Purchases, Renewals &amp; Cancellations support page</a>.

<strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal.</strong> You can manage and cancel your Paid Services at the respective Service’s site. For example, you can manage all of your Using-Blockchain.com plans through your Using-Blockchain.com <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/me/purchases">Manage Purchases page</a>. To cancel a Using-Blockchain.com plan, go to your <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/me/purchases">Manage Purchases page</a>, click on the plan you wish to cancel, then follow the instructions to “cancel the subscription.” You must repeat this process for each subscription you wish to cancel.

<strong>Fee Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were previously free. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee changes. If you don’t agree with the fee changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.

<b>No-Show Policy. </b>We may have a “no-show policy” for some Paid Services (for example, for our <a href="https://support.using-blockchain.com/quick-start-support/#purchasing-a-session">Quick Start sessions</a>), which means that if you fail to show up or are late for a scheduled session, we may withhold the Service without a refund.

<strong>Refunds.</strong> While you may cancel a Paid Service at any time, refunds are issued in our sole discretion, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
<h3>b. Fees Collected by Website Owners</h3>
<strong>Fees Paid to Websites or Website Owners.</strong> Website owners may choose to sell items (goods, content, services, etc.), offer subscriptions for their websites at specific price points and intervals, or simply collect payments. Please note that we are not involved in a website’s subscription details, or a website’s store operations (including the quality, timing, pricing, or legality of what may or may not be included in exchange for payment, or any goods or services purchased). If you purchase items or subscriptions from a website, your purchase is directly from the website owner, who is solely responsible for the items sold. Please contact the website owner if you have any questions or complaints.

<strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> Any recurring payments you make to a website owner (such as a <a href="https://support.using-blockchain.com/recurring-payments/">website subscription</a>) are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel your website subscription before the end of the applicable renewal period, it will automatically renew. Your recurring payments will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, for an annual renewal schedule for your website subscription, you will be charged each year. You can view your renewal date by visiting your <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/me/purchases/other">Other Sites page</a>.

<strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal of Website Subscriptions.</strong> You can manage and cancel your website subscriptions at your <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/me/purchases/other">Other Sites page</a>. Click on the automatically renewing payment you wish to cancel, then follow the instructions to cancel. You must repeat this process for each website subscription you wish to cancel.

<strong>Refunds.</strong> We are not responsible for refunds for fees paid to a website owner because those transactions are between website owners and their users. If you would like to request a refund for any fees paid to a website or website owner, please contact the website owner. If you have a complaint regarding a website owner, you can <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/abuse/">contact us</a>.

<h2>7. Specific Service Terms</h2>
<h3>a. Using-Blockchain.com and UBC.Digital Websites and Accounts</h3>
<a href="https://using-blockchain.com/">Using-Blockchain.com</a> and <a href="https://ubc.digital">UBC.Digital</a> enables you to create blockchain networks, and we would love for you to use it. A Using-Blockchain.com account, or a UBC.Digital acccount also allows you to sign into some of our Services.

Using-Blockchain.com’s and UBC.Digital's basic services are free, and we offer <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/pricing/">paid plans</a> for advanced features such as a custom domain name, extra storage, and access to premium blockchain features. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes on your blockchain network as possible and encourage you to express yourself freely. You own all content you post to your websites and account. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appear on your website.

If you find a Using-Blockchain.com or UBC.Digital website that you believe violates these Terms, please visit our <a href="http://support.using-blockchain.com/disputes/">dispute resolution and reporting page</a>.

<strong>Your Using-Blockchain.com Website or UBC.Digital Website.</strong> If you create a website on Using-Blockchain.com, or if you create a website on UBC.Digital, you get to use an Using Blockchain Ltd-owned subdomain, such as example.using-blockchain.com or bobs.blockchain.network. You must not engage in “domain squatting,” claim an unreasonable number of subdomains (as determined by us), or sell access to any subdomains.

<strong>License.</strong> By submitting Content to Using Blockchain Ltd for inclusion on your website, you grant Using Blockchain Ltd a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your website. This license also allows Using Blockchain Ltd to make any publicly-posted Content available to third parties selected by Using Blockchain Ltd so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) the Content through their services. You also give other Using-Blockchain.com users permission to share your Content on other Using-Blockchain.com websites and add their own Content to it (aka to “reblog” your Content), so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your website (the <a href="https://support.using-blockchain.com/reblogs/">reblogging function</a> on Using-Blockchain.com does this automatically!).

<strong>Removing Content.</strong> If you delete Content, we will use reasonable efforts to remove it from public view (or in the case of a private website, from view by the authorized visitors) on Using-Blockchain.com, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.

<strong>Prohibited Uses.</strong> By using Using-Blockchain.com, you represent and warrant that your Content and conduct do not violate the <a href="https://support.using-blockchain.com/user-guidelines/">User Guidelines</a>.

<strong>HTTPS.</strong> We offer free HTTPS on all Using-Blockchain.com websites by default, including those using custom domains, via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>. By signing up and using a custom domain on Using-Blockchain.com, you authorize us to act on the domain name registrant’s behalf (by requesting the necessary certificates, for example) for the sole purpose of providing HTTPS on your website.

<strong>Advertisements.</strong> We reserve the right to display advertisements on your website unless you have purchased a plan that includes the removal of ads.

<strong>Attribution.</strong> We reserve the right to display attribution text or links in your website footer or toolbar, attributing Using-Blockchain.com or the feature author, for example. Some of these attributions may not be altered or removed.

&nbsp;
<h2>8. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h2>
As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or associated with an Using Blockchain Ltd product or service violates your copyright, please notify us in accordance with <a href="https://using-blockchain.com/dmca-notice/">Using Blockchain Ltd's Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) Policy</a>. We will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. We will terminate a visitor’s access to and use of the website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Using Blockchain Ltd or others. In the case of such termination, we will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to us.

&nbsp;
<h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
The Agreement does not transfer from Using Blockchain Ltd to you any Using Blockchain Ltd or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Using Blockchain Ltd. Using Blockchain Ltd, Using Blockchain Magazine, YourDLT.com, the Using-Blockchain.com logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with Using-Blockchain.com or our Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of Using Blockchain Ltd or Using Blockchain Ltd's licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of our Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Using Blockchain Ltd or third party trademarks.

&nbsp;
<h2>10. Third Party Services</h2>
In using the Services, you may enable or use services, products, software (like themes or plugins), embeds, or applications developed by a third party or yourself (“Third Party Services”) on your website.

If you use any Third Party Services, you understand that:
<ul>
 	<li>Third Party Services are not vetted, endorsed, or controlled by Using Blockchain Ltd.</li>
 	<li>Any use of a Third Party Service is at your own risk, and we shall not be responsible or liable to anyone for Third Party Services.</li>
 	<li>Your use is solely between you and the respective third party (“Third Party”) and will be governed by the Third Party’s terms and policies. It is your responsibility to review the Third Party’s terms and policies before using a Third Party Service.</li>
 	<li>Some Third Party Services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors’, or customers’) data, for example, via a pixel or cookie. If you use the Third Party Service or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the Third Party’s privacy policy and practices. We do not have control over how a Third Party Service may use your data. You should carefully review Third Party Services’ data collection, retention, and use policies and practices before enabling Third Party Services.</li>
 	<li>Third Party Services may not work appropriately with your website, and we may not be able to provide support for issues caused by any Third Party Services.</li>
 	<li>If you have questions or concerns about how a Third Party Service operates, or need support, please contact the Third Party directly.</li>
</ul>
In rare cases, we may at our discretion, suspend, disable, or remove Third Party Services from your account or website.
<h2>11. Changes</h2>
We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. These Terms may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Using Blockchain Ltd, or by the posting by Using Blockchain Ltd of a revised version. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period, or once the changes become effective. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.
<h2>12. Termination</h2>
We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. We have the right (though not the obligation) to, in our sole discretion, (i) reclaim your username or website’s URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any Using Blockchain Ltd policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make some adjustments, restrict the resources your website uses, or terminate your Services, if we believe your website’s storage or bandwidth usage is out of hand and burdens our systems (which is rare and typically only occurs when a website is used for file sharing or storage), or (iv) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

If you wish to terminate the Agreement or your Using-Blockchain.com account, you may simply discontinue using our Services, or, if you are using a paid service, you may cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section in these Terms.

All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.
<h2>13. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p class="important">Our Services are provided “as is.” Using Blockchain Ltd and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither Using Blockchain Ltd, nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or otherwise obtain content or services through, our Services at your own discretion and risk.</p>

<h2>14. Jurisdiction and Applicable Law.</h2>
<p class="important">Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of England, excluding its conflict of law provisions.

<h2>15. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p class="important">In no event will Using Blockchain Ltd, or its suppliers, partners, or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed $50 or the fees paid by you to Using Blockchain Ltd under the Agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action, whichever is greater. Using Blockchain Ltd shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<h2>16. Indemnification</h2>
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Using Blockchain Ltd, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in connection with the Services, Content that you post, and any ecommerce activities conducted through your or another user’s website.
<h2>17. Translation</h2>
These Terms were originally written in English (UK). We may translate these terms into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.
<h2>18. Miscellaneous</h2>
The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Using Blockchain Ltd and you concerning the subject matter hereof. If any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.

You may assign your rights under the Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Using Blockchain Ltd may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. The Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
