## Our work

As a team at Using Blockchain Ltd, we have contributed to the many open standard definitions published by @eVias over the past years, including but not limited to [NIP-13](https://github.com/nemtech/NIP/blob/master/NIPs/nip-0013.md) for defining Security Tokens with Symbol from NEM, [NIP-6](https://github.com/nemtech/NIP/blob/master/NIPs/nip-0006.md) for using Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets with Symbol from NEM and lately [NIP-16](https://github.com/nemtech/NIP/blob/master/NIPs/nip-0016.md) which focusses on providing a smooth Components experience when working with Symbol from NEM.

We put our focus on qualitative and innovative development skills and our headline is that **open source is a beautiful way to collaborate**. Many of our software packages are available at Github. That is because we believe in an open access to innovation.

Our latest products include:
